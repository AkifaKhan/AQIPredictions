# AQIPredictions
Air Quality Index (AQI) is a crucial metric for assessing the quality of air in a given area. This report outlines the development and implementation of an AQI prediction system that utilizes various data sources, machine learning techniques, and a feature store for efficient data management.
## 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of the AQI prediction system are:
•	To predict future AQI values based on historical air quality and weather data.
•	To provide insights into the factors affecting air quality.
•	To facilitate timely alerts for poor air quality conditions.
